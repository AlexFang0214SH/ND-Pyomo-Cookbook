    "# Getting Started with Pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a Python software package for modeling and solving optimization problems. Using Pyomo, a user creates an optimization model by specifying decision **variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective**. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems. A user then uses Pyomo to do any necessary model transformations, specifies a solver, and computes a solution. Typically other graphics or data packages will be used to post-process the solution for display."

The Anaconda distribution available from [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) is among the most complete and best known distributions currently available, and is available as a [free download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or in commercially supported enterprise version.

Generally there is no need to install the optional Microsoft VSCode. \n",

The Python class `Var()` is used to specify these as real numbers that must be greater than or equal to zero.\n",

    "    model.profit = Objective(expr = 40*model.x + 30*model.y, sense=maximize)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4.  Create a solver object and solve.\n",

    "The Pyomo libary includes a `SolverFactory()` class used to specify a solver. In this case, because the problem is a linear programming problem, we use the `glpk` solver. \n",
