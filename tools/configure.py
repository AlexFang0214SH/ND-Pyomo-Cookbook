# ND Pyomo Cookbook

This **ND Pyomo Cookbook** is a collection of notebooks with information and recipes for the use of 
[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) to solve modeling and optimization problems. With Pyomo, one can embed an 
optimization model consisting of **decision variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective** within
Python. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems.

The notebooks in this collection were developed for instructional purposes at Notre Dame. The notebooks were originally
developed using the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). They have been subsequently
updated to open in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) where they can be run in a browser window.

PyomoFest at Notre Dame was held June 5-7, 2018. This repository contains the 
[agenda](https://github.com/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/tree/master/PyomoFest/PyomoFest.md), 
[slides](https://github.com/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/tree/master/PyomoFest/slides) and
[exercises](https://github.com/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/tree/master/PyomoFest/exercises_wo_soln/exercises)
distributed during that event.
