# ND Pyomo Cookbook

[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a state-of-the-art Python package for modeling and solving optimization problems. 
Using Pyomo, a user can embed an optimization model consisting of **decision variables**, **constraints**, and 
an optimization **objective** within Python. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems.

This repository provides instructions on getting started with Pyomo, and a collection of Pyomo modeling notebooks that 
have been developed for instructional purposes at Notre Dame. The notebooks were originally developed using the 
[Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).The notebooks have been recently updated to open 
directly on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which requires only a browser window to run.

PyomoFest at Notre Dame was held June 5-7, 2018. This repository contains the [agenda](PyomoFest.md), 
[slides](https://github.com/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/tree/master/PyomoFest/slides) and
[exercises](https://github.com/jckantor/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/tree/master/PyomoFest/exercises_wo_soln/exercises)
distributed during that event.
