# ND-Pyomo-Cookbook

[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a state-of-the-art package for modeling and solving optimization problems embedded within Python. Using Pyomo, a user can describe optimization model by specifying decision **variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective**. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems, specifying a solver, and displaying the solution.

This repository provides examples of Pyomo models that have been developed for instructional purposes at Notre Dame.
