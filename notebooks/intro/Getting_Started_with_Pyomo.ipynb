    "[Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/) is a Python software package to assist with modeling and solving optimization problems. Using Pyomo, a user creates an optimization model by specifying decision **variables**, **constraints**, and an optimization **objective**. Pyomo includes a rich set of features to enable modeling of complex systems, specifying a solver, and displaying the solution."

    "These instructions assume you have previously installed the [Anaconda package for Python 3.x](https://www.anaconda.com/download) package for Python software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following commands install Pyomo and dependencies. These commands need to be executed one at a time from a [terminal window on MacOS](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac), or from a [command window on Windows](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8).\n",

The solvers [glpk](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK) (mixed integer linear optimization) and [ipopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPOPT) (nonlinear optimization) cover a wide range of optimization models that arise in process systems engineering and provide good starting point for learning Pyomo.

    "## Key Concepts in Pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Pyomo application involves the creation of at least two Pyomo objects from the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ConcreteModel()**  A python object representing the optimization problem to be solved.\n",
    "* **SolverFactory()** A python object representing the mathematical progamming software to be used for calculating a solution.\n",

    "There are a number of of open-source and commercial solvers that can be used with Pyomo. This simple structure allows one to test and find solvers suited to a particular application.  \n",

    "A model, in turn, is composed of additional objects used to specify a problem. A minimal set of classes is needed to create useful models. These classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Var()** Objects representing variables determined in the course of solving a particular problem.\n",
    "* **Objective()** An object denoting the problem objective function that is to be either minimized or maximized.\n",
    "* **Constraint()** Objects representing problem constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell presents a typical example."

    "## Example: Linear Production Model with Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formulation of a simple linear production model is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\max_{x,y \\geq 0} &\\ 40\\ x + 30\\ y  & \\mbox{objective}\\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{subject to:}\\qquad \\\\\n",
    "x & \\leq 40  & \\mbox{demand constraint} \\\\\n",
    "x + y & \\leq 80  & \\mbox{labor A constraint} \\\\\n",
    "2x + y & \\leq 100 & \\mbox{labor B constraint}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ and $y$ are the rates of production (in units per week) for two products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1. Import Pyomo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in any Pyomo project is to import relevant components of the Pyomo library. This can be done with the following python statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from pyomo.environ import *\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Step 2. Create the model object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo provides two distinct methods to create models. Here we use `ConcreteModel()` to create a model instance which is appropriate when all of the data needed to complete the model is avaiable at the current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model = ConcreteModel()\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Python variable `model` stores the model instance. This could be any valid Python variable name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Step 3. Add the Decision Variables, Objective, and Constraints to the model object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major component of a Pyomo model are decision variables which are added as fields to `model`. In the case we name the fields `model.x` and `model.y` corresponding to $x$ and $y$ in the process model. The Python class `Var()` is used to specify these as real numbers that must be greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.x = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals)\n",
    "    model.y = Var(domain=NonNegativeReals)\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we will see in other examples, the `domain` can specify other types of decision variables including reals, integers, and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is specified as an algebraic expression involving the decision variables. Here we store the objective in `model.profit`, and use the optional keyword `sense` to specify a maximization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.profit = Objective(expr = 40*model.x + 30*model.y, sense=maximize)\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are added as fields to the model, each constraint created using the `Constraint()` class. The constraints are specified using the `expr` keywork in the form of linear algebraic expressions of the decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    model.demand = Constraint(expr = model.x <= 40)\n",
    "    model.laborA = Constraint(expr = model.x + model.y <= 80)\n",
    "    model.laborB = Constraint(expr = 2*model.x + model.y <= 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4.  Create a solver object and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pyomo libary includes a `SolverFactory()` class used to specify a solver. In this case, because the problem is a linear programming problem, we use the `glpk` solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "    results = SolverFactory('glpk').solve(model)\n",
    "    results.write()\n",
    "    if results.solver.status == 'ok':\n",
    "        model.pprint()\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `solve()` method attempts to solve the model using the specified solver, and returns `results` which can be inspected to see if, in fact, a solution was found. If a solution is found, then `model` will have a pretty-print method `pprint()` that creates a summary of the problem solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5. Display the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most applications will require access to specific components of the model. If a solution is found, the model will include methods with the same name as the fields created above, and which can be used to access solution values.\n",
